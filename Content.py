\n\nWe would not be surprised if some of these thoughts have crossed your mind, but by the end of this course, we know that you will see Bitcoin differently.

When it comes to money, Africa has some real problems:
(a). Legal tender devaluation.
(b). Increasing weakness of your currency compared to other countries.
(c). Selfish economic policies.
(d). High transaction fees for sending money in and out of Africa.
(e). Government control and scrutiny of money and transactions.

If you have been frustrated by any of these, please keep an open mind for the next 21 days. In this time, we aim to give you knowledge that will change your life for the better, forever. We believe Bitcoin holds a real opportunity for Africa because it is money that cannot be corrupted. Our mission is to help as many Africans as possible understand and adopt Bitcoin as their means of saving and spending.
If we do our job right, this will be a life-changing experience for you, as it was for each member of this community when they started their Bitcoin learning journey.

day_1 = str("""‚úÖ <b>DAY 1</b> ‚úÖ\n\nBefore diving into the digital currency "Bitcoin", we must first understand the concept and history of money itself.
        
In early civilizations, trade happened by barter. People exchanged one form of desirable good or service for another desirable good or service. The key word here is ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù. The items for exchange had to be something desired by both parties. So, assuming you had apples and wanted oranges, you would have had to look for someone who had oranges and wanted apples, this ‚Äúdouble coincidence of wants‚Äù was the greatest disadvantage of the trading system.

Over time humans developed a desire to own certain collectible items for their scarcity and symbolic value (examples of this include shells, animal teeth, and glass beads). They would sell their goods and services for these precious collectibles. The problem with this became that one society was using multiple collectibles as a means of exchange of goods and services. So, early man was faced with a dilemma ‚Äúwhat one item could be desirable to everyone?‚Äù.

The Shekel in Mesopotamia was the first adoption of a general store of value after which many civilizations began to adopt stamped silver and gold coins as currency. Gold became the best store of value/currency on the free market; as the commodity providing the most stable and desirable monetary medium. The supply and provision of gold were subject only to market forces, but the downfall was the weight. Gold and coins were very heavy in large amounts and so paper money was introduced. The first ever paper money was recorded in China before other countries like America and England adopted it.

As trades started between civilizations, the stores of value that had emerged in different civilizations came to compete against each other. Between 1815 and 1914, several governments including the American, British, and French decided to use gold as a standard to measure value, which meant that each national currency (the Dollar, Pound, Franc etc.) was merely a name for a certain defined weight of gold. 

This worked for a while, but just like now in modern times, it was foolish to trust governments to maintain a standard of seeing to it that Pounds, Dollars, Francs etc. were always redeemable in gold as they and their controlled banking system had pledged. At the start of World War 1, the gold standard broke down, but it was not gold that failed; it was the government that failed. They failed because to wage the war, each government (except for the USA which entered the war late), had to print money which inflated the supply of paper and bank currency. So severe was this inflation that it was impossible for the warring governments to keep their pledges. They went "off the gold standard" ‚Äì their money was no longer backed by gold.""")

day_1_cont = str("""This Inflation of print money supply led to the depreciation of currencies that had their supply inflated during the war. And the British pound was one of the currencies to suffer this depreciation. But Britain couldn't stand losing the  ‚Äúhard money‚Äù reputation it had before the war. So they decided to return to the gold standard at its old hard money rate. As a result of combining inflation with a return to an overpriced market exchange rate, British exports suffered depression during the 1920s and unemployment was severe meanwhile most of the world was experiencing an economic boom. As Britain inflated, they experienced a deficit in their balance of payments because instead of other countries redeeming their pounds for gold, they kept the pounds and inflated on top of it. This failure of banks in Europe and France to cash in their sterling balances for gold led Britain to go off the gold standard completely.

The United States remained on the gold standard until 1933-1934 in a vain attempt to get out of the depression that hit them at that time. American citizens could no longer redeem dollars in gold and were even prohibited from owning any gold, either in the United States or abroad. After 1934, The United States adopted a new form of the gold standard in which the dollar, now redefined to 1/35 of a gold ounce, was redeemable in gold to foreign governments and central banks.


The new system was essentially the gold-exchange standard of the 1920s, but with the dollar rudely displacing the British pound as the "key currency". Now the dollar, valued at 1/35 of a gold ounce, was to be the only key currency. The dollar was no longer redeemable in gold to American citizens; instead, it was only redeemable in gold to foreign governments and their central banks. No private individuals, only governments, were to be allowed the privilege of redeeming dollars in the world's gold currency.

From this brief history, you can see how governments manipulate currency to satisfy their quest for global recognition.

Isn't it just disappointing to realise that the money you have been stacking in your bank isn‚Äôt entirely yours to control? 

You don‚Äôt have a say on its value in the free market and if your policy makers decide one day that money was no longer acceptable, you have to adopt whatever they feel is acceptable.

Money is any ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù item or verifiable record generally accepted as payment for goods and services and, now more than ever, the most desirable quality of money is decentralised custody.

Yesterday, we learned that money is anything that is valuable and generally accepted by many. But what properties make anything valuable enough to be considered a store of value? Why can‚Äôt we pick up pebbles in the street and adopt that as our primary store of value? Or apples, everyone loves those so why can't an apple be considered money?

Today, we will learn about the properties that make anything valuable enough to be considered money.

The 10 properties

1. <b>Desirable:</b> Yesterday, we told you that every nation decided on gold as a central measure of their currency's worth in the free market. Why gold? Well, because they all wanted gold so a store of value should be desirable to everyone who wants to use it.

2. <b>Durable:</b> No matter how sweet apples or strawberries are, they can't be usedas money because they are perishable. A store of value must be long-lasting both in terms of value and material life shelf.

3. <b>Scarce:</b> Pebbles are common and in ample supply all over the world. Anyone could have pebbles just by running around and picking them up so that wouldn‚Äôt do as a store of value. Anything consideted money must not be common, and it must have a limited supply. In other words, it must be scarce as this is what makes it desirable

4. <b>Divisibility:</b> Money must have the capacity to be broken down into the smallest division or fractions.

5. <b>Known history:</b> The longer a form of money has existed, the more valuable people will agree with its value.""")

day_2_cont = str("""6. Verifiable: For anything can be considered money, it  must be verifiable as being authentic.

7. <b>Fungible:</b> If a good or asset is interchangeable by the same measure of the good or asset, it is said to be fungible. For example, a gallon of diesel is fungible because it is equal and interchangeable with another gallon of diesel. 1 ounce of gold is interchangeable with another ounce of gold and 1 cedi is equal to another 1 cedi.

8. <b>Portable:</b> Money has to be portable enough to be carried around when needed. When compared to most stores of value like silver and gold coins or Yapese people's Rai stones, nothing beats Bitcoin in terms of portability. You could have 50 million satoshis locked away in a cold wallet that looks like a flash or in your phone. 

9. <b>Censorship resistant:</b> The use or existence of any money should be resistant to suppression by any group or government.

10. <b>Decentralised:</b> Recently, the most desirable property of money is the ability to not have to rely on any bank, company, or other centralised authority, but instead use a system that allows users to have complete control over the entire system. Bitcoin is the only currency that can boast of complete decentralisation.

desirable. On 9 out of 10 of those properties, Bitcoin comes out as the clear winner. The only one it doesn‚Äôt knock the park out on is ‚Äúknown history‚Äù, but that‚Äôs ok ‚Äì old isn‚Äôt necessarily the best

Today we will be digging into the qualities that make Bitcoin irresistible. Don‚Äôt worry if you come across terms that you don‚Äôt really understand yet. It‚Äôs all part of the process and they will be clearly explained as we work through the course.

Bitcoin‚Äôs 11 best qualities

<b>Decentralisation:</b> Bitcoin has no central controlling power! Bitcoin decentralisation provides many advantages: resistance to seizure, tax, and theft.

<b>Transparency:</b> No one can know how much bitcoin you own. At the same time, your public address, the amount of bitcoin in your public address, the number of transactions you have made, and the addresses that received and sent bitcoin from and to you are visible to everyone on the blockchain. So, the Bitcoin system is a perfect blend of privacy and transparency.

<b>Privacy:</b> Bitcoin privacy is not easy because Bitcoin protocol runs on a public and Pseudonymous network called the Blockchain, so as much as Bitcoin offers strong anonymity to users, privacy is still dependent on the users privacy practices. Click here to see some privacy practices.

<b>Lightning speed transactions:</b> Compared to banks or any other method of transaction, Bitcoin is faster. Sending money from one side of the world to another happens in minutes when transacting on-chain and at lightning speed off-chain.""")

day_3_cont = str("""<b>Digital currency:</b> Bitcoin is not physically present in the form of notes or coins, unlike Fiat and gold.

<b>Value is determined by demand:</b> There is no fixed value or price. Bitcoin‚Äôs value and price entirely depend on its demand. The members of the Bitcoin ecosystem determine the cost and value of bitcoin in the market.

<b>What you have is what you have:</b> The amount of bitcoin you buy or earn is exactly the amount you have. The market value could increase or decrease, but your bitcoin balance never changes. There is a common misconception that Bitcoin is some kind of pyramid scheme. Let‚Äôs put that idea to rest right now because it is not. When it comes to pyramid schemes, all the participants are salespeople, and income is mostly based on existing participants recruiting more participants to the network rather than actual product sales. The recruitment process often includes product sales and promises sky-high income for handing in your money and getting others to do the same.

<b>Fixed supply:</b> Bitcoin is the only currency that can guarantee a fixed supply forever. Only 21 million bitcoins exist, and everyone knows that and can verify it on the blockchain. This is a big advantage over Fiat currency which no one apart from federal reserves has an estimate of how much Fiat is in circulation.

<b>Governed by everyone:</b> Everyone who runs a node is part of the consensus that can decide if transactions are valid or not and can decide on not having any changes made to the Bitcoin core, unlike the Fiat system where the Central bank makes all monetary decisions and we all must just ‚Äúgo with their flow‚Äù.

<b>Transactions cannot be easily manipulated:</b> Transactions can only be manipulated if 51% of the Bitcoin mining power is controlled by the manipulator. This is called a 51% attack. A 51% attack occurs when a person or group takes control of more than half of all the computing power or validation authority of a cryptocurrency network. Having majority control of a cryptocurrency‚Äôs blockchain enables that group or person to create and manipulate transactions. Some examples of 51% attacks: Bitcoin Gold, 2018: Bitcoin Gold, a cryptocurrency originally based on Bitcoin, suffered an attack that led to $18 million in theft from cryptocurrency exchanges.1 Ethereum Classic, 2019: This crypto based on the Ethereum blockchain experienced a 51% attack that led to roughly $1.1 million stolen. A miner or validator would need a massive amount of computing power or a huge stake in Bitcoin to successfully conduct a 51% attack. The good news is that controlling 51% of the mining hardware and paying for 51% of the energy use of a large crypto network like Bitcoin is both extremely expensive and logistically impractical and owning 51% of a cryptocurrency itself is cost prohibitive. These inherent limitations are how control of the Bitcoin network stays decentralised.

<b>Bitcoin cannot be destroyed:</b> Bitcoin is decentralised and there are over 100 000 running nodes distributed all over the world. Even if 90% of these nodes are shut down or destroyed, the 10% left will still be enough to keep the Bitcoin network alive.

day_4 = str("""‚úÖ <b>DAY 4</b> ‚úÖ\n\nHere are some other questions to think about.

Why are we dedicating our time to creating Bitcoin awareness? 

Why are people dumping Fiat currencies and adopting Bitcoin as their primary store of value?

Why did El‚Äô Salvador adopt Bitcoin as its legal tender?

What is driving people to learn about Bitcoin in this high inflation environment?

Let‚Äôs look at this example:
Tola is a Nigerian living in America. In 2019, he sent 10 000 Dollars (the equivalent to 3.6 million Naira) home to a fixed deposit savings account at the rate of 1 Dollar to 360 Nigerian Naira with a 5% interest yield after 3 years. Fast forward to 2022, Tola needs $10 000  for a foreign investment and decides to use the 3.6 million Naira out of the money he kept at the bank, but he gets a shock when he gets to the bank. His 3.6 million Naira is no longer worth $10 000 but $8 545. His savings have depreciated by 14.6% and his $10 000 spending power has depreciated drastically. In 2019, Tola could buy a plot of land for 3.5 million but in 2022 the same land was sold for 8 million Naira. A whopping price increment (inflation) rate of 112% in 4 years. And to make matters worse his international spending limit was reduced to 50 dollars a month.
We want to highlight 4 important lessons from this example that will highlight the problems of Fiat and how Bitcoin solves each problem.""")

day_4_cont = str("""<b>The monetary system:</b> Nigeria, like most African countries, is a Dollar dependent country because it is a consumer country and there is an over 60% Dollar element in many of their consumer goods. The problem with depending on an international currency is that because it's not yours to print, supply for the currency will always be scarce so you will only be absorbing the cost of Dollars. As the country is highly import-dependent, there aren't enough Dollars to match their growing demand for Dollars. They must print Naira in excess to buy more Dollars and because traders need Dollars to import their goods, they are willing to pay any amount for the Dollars making the Naira worth less and causing abnormally high rates of inflation of goods and services and eventually economic crises. Bitcoin is dependent on only one thing‚Ä¶ Bitcoin, and it is a universal currency which provides equality for all. For import-dependent countries, if a tonne of plastic costs 5 million satoshis in China, someone from Zimbabwe will pay exactly 5 million satoshis for it.

<b>Currency devaluation:</b> Devaluation of a country‚Äôs currency when the 60% of the economy is Dollar dependent leads to devaluation of the currency‚Äôs spending power. This is why the amount of groceries one could buy with 20 000 Naira last year is far more than what 200 000 Naira can buy you today. There will never be anything more than 21 million Bitcoin which means that supply is fixed and subsequently as more people adopt bitcoin, it will become more valuable.

<b>Inflation:</b>  Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. As most African nations are highly dependent on imported goods; prices of goods rise and fall not based on their currency, but on Dollars which is the import market money standard. So, as the demand for Dollars increases so too does the cost for it which leads to inflation of prices of goods and services. As more people adopt Bitcoin and its price increases, the ratio of inflation to Bitcoin spending power will reduce drastically. And because the price of importing goods and services is the same, the rate of inflation might not be as extreme as current situations.

<b>Government manipulations:</b> Governments always want to be in control, they set rules and bans as countermeasures to correct their mistakes with no regards to the adverse effects of these laws on citizens. Tola ended up losing out on his international investment because even if he could get the 10 000 Dollars he was only permitted to send 50 dollars every month. Bitcoin solves this problem because there is no sanction on the amount you can transfer or buy per time.

These are the reason why we really believe in Bitcoin!

Here are 6 things you should never forget about Bitcoin.

1. <b>Bitcoin price is volatile:</b> The price can rise or fall in unpredictable ways over a short period of time due to its young economy, new nature, and sometimes non-liquid markets. That‚Äôs why Bitcoin for your short-term savings is not recommended at this point. But no one has ever lost money saving bitcoin for more than 5 years, what other currency can say that?

2. <b>Bitcoin payments are irreversible:</b> Once you have sent out a payment and received a confirmation, your bitcoin is gone forever and can't be reversed back to you. So, you need to be certain of the address to which you are sending your bitcoin.

3. <b>Bitcoin is not anonymous:</b> Bitcoin records all transactions in a public ledger so everyone on the blockchain can see transactions made by your address.

4. Bitcoin is not yet an official currency in most parts of the world

5. Unconfirmed transactions are not secure.

6. <b>Not your keys, not your Bitcoin:</b> If you do not have control over your private keys, then you do not actually 'own' your Bitcoin.

Because we are dealing with a relatively new currency you can even follow some of the people we mention like Adam Back, David Chaum, and Nicholas Szabo on Twitter. A modern-day historyüòÉ

David Chaum‚Äôs DigiCash

Adam Back‚Äôs Hashcash

Wei Dai‚Äôs B-money

Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs Bitcoin (our favorite, obviously)



The 3 basic questions anyone accepting digital money should consider are:

Can I trust this currency to be valuable? 

Can I trust that I have complete access to my funds with no third party involved? 

Can I trust that no one else can steal these funds?""")



day_6_cont = str("""Before Bitcoin, many digital money prototypes failed to pass the test when it came to these 3 questions. Satoshi Nakamoto answered these questions in his White paper, published in October 2008. Nakamoto combined prior inventions such as B-money and Hashcash to create a completely decentralised electronic cash system that does not rely on a central authority for currency issuance or settlement and validation of transactions. Bitcoin is both a new currency and a new kind of payment system. It‚Äôs unique in the way it works using a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending and money creation.


<b>Bitcoin consists of:</b>

A decentralised peer-to-peer network (the Bitcoin protocol): is a payment method that is usually used to transfer funds directly within a community of users without a third party.

A public transaction ledger (the blockchain): is a set of predefined records that are added to the chain of blocks. Each block contains a linked list of records, called transactions.

A set of rules (consensus rules): a set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance.

A mechanism (Proof-of-Work algorithm): for reaching a globally decentralised consensus on the valid blockchain.

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and as of 19 August 2022, there is exactly 19,124,825 bitcoin in existence. How does more bitcoin get created, you may ask? Today we are digging into bitcoin mining the mind-blowing innovation through which more bitcoin is created.



Mining is the process by which a new bitcoin is generated in the Bitcoin system. This involves the verification of new transactions in the Bitcoin network and creating a block of these transactions for verification by the Bitcoin nodes, every time a block is confirmed by the bitcoin network, miners get new bitcoins including transaction fees from each transaction on the block as a reward.


Transactions sit in a queue called a mempool and are ordered based on who pays the highest fee. Miners compete to build a block of transactions and once they win, they create the block and it is added to the chain. Each block can hold about 2000 transactions so if you paid enough in a fee your transaction will be included in the block.""")

day_7_cont = str("""<b>Bitcoin Mining Basics:</b>

<b>The Mempool:</b> is short for ‚Äúmemory pool‚Äù and is a group of transactions waiting for confirmation in the Bitcoin network. A high Mempool size indicates more network traffic which will result in longer average confirmation time and higher priority fees. If the transaction is in the Mempool for 48 hours, it will drop from all of the Bitcoin Mempools and the funds will be returned to the wallet it was sent from.

A block is a group of transactions from the Mempool stacked together by miners to send to the Bitcoin nodes for validation. A block records some, or all, of the most recent transactions not yet validated by the network. Once the data are validated, the block is closed and added to the chain of blocks.

A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared amongst the nodes of the Bitcoin network. As a database, a blockchain stores transaction ledgers electronically in digital format. The Blockchain preserves and decentralises reports of transactions. Blockchain innovation guarantees the reliability and security of all information, reports and transactions without the want of a trusted third party.

A transaction fee is a charge you pay to have your bitcoin payment transaction verified.When a user generates a transaction, they have to include a transaction fee to be paid to miners to incentivise miners to get their transactions to the blockchain. When a miner finds a block, they get a block reward plus the transaction from all transactions in the block. As each block contains a restricted number of spaces, miners will generally try to get transactions with higher fees to the blockchain first. Consequently, this is the reason why users generating Bitcoin transactions are in a fixed bidding war where the transaction fees sway because of the number of transactions required to be processed. An unprocessed transaction sits in the Mempool. To avoid waiting too long in the Mempool for transaction validation, users making quick transactions may opt to pay higher fees than those who aren‚Äôt in a rush.

Proof of work is a decentralised consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving a mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody from gaming the system. Miners in the Bitcoin network compete against each other in solving complex computational puzzles. These puzzles are difficult to solve, but the correct solution is easy to verify. Once a miner has found the solution to the puzzle, they will be able to broadcast the block to the Bitcoin network where all the other miners will then verify that the solution is correct.



Today, you have learnt that mining is the process by which new bitcoin is generated by solving mathematical problems that confirm transactions in the Mempool. We know that it is quite complex, read the lesson a few times over. This will all start getting clearer soon.



And we hope that you are earning as much as you can from the Carrot App we shared yesterdayüòé.

Compared to the day you signed up to take this course, we hope you have a better understanding of Bitcoin? 



Bitcoin lets people exchange money electronically as easily as sending an email or text. To send money, you use a ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù app to type in an amount, enter or scan a recipient‚Äôs account number, and hit ‚ÄúSend‚Äù. The recipient will then see the money pop up in their account. Every time you hit ‚ÄúSend‚Äù, your Wallet app sends a message to the Bitcoin network telling it how the ledger should change, the sender‚Äôs and recipient‚Äôs public address, and the amount to transfer.



So how does it work?

At a basic level, Bitcoin is just a ledger with account numbers and balances. When we send you 100 satoshis, our balance goes down by 100 sats, and yours goes up by 100 sats. There‚Äôs no gold or government-issued money backing these numbers, just people‚Äôs belief that the numbers are worth something, and a system that prevents unfair changes. 



So, what‚Äôs to prevent a thief from creating a message transferring money from someone else‚Äôs address?



When a new public address is created, it comes along with a private key mathematically linked to that address that only the true account owner knows, and this key is used to create signatures. To create a signature, a private key and the text from a transaction are fed into a special cryptographic function. Another function allows other people to check the signature, making sure it was created by the public address owner, and that it applies to that specific transaction.

The signature serves the same purpose as a handwritten signature on a paper check, but based on math rather than handwriting. Unlike the handwritten version, these signatures can't be copied and reused in the future, as they're unique to each transaction. So, these signatures keep unauthorised transactions from changing the ledger, but who exactly is checking the signatures, and overall, maintaining the ledger?

Surprisingly, anyone who wants to!



As new transactions are created, they go into a pool of pending transactions. From there, they'll be sorted into a giant chain that locks in their order. To select which transaction is next, a kind of mathematical lottery is held by miners who select a pending transaction of their choice and begin trying to solve a math problem that will link it to the end of the chain every 10 minutes. The first person to find a solution wins and get to have their transaction selected as the next in the chain.""")



day_8_cont = str("""One of the main goals of Bitcoin is to provide a decentralised system, meaning no single company or government can control it. Every time someone sends money, a transaction message is passed around to all the people who want to help maintain the ledger, by running a node. Each of these nodes keeps a personal copy of the ledger and updates it whenever they receive a new transaction with a valid signature. With ledgers spread all over the world, traffic delays (and occasionally fraud) can lead to differences in those ledgers. So how does the world decide which version to use?

Other node runners ‚Äúvote‚Äù by trying to solve the math problem based on their version of the ledger. The first person to solve a puzzle announces their solution and everyone updates to that version. So, the vote turns out to be a kind of mathematical race, but it‚Äôs designed to favour the majority‚Äôs version. This is because the more people there are working on a particular version, the faster it will be solved.



So, why math problems instead of something like emailing in votes to decide on a ledger? Without a central authority to register voters, it would be hard to enforce one vote per person. A single person could create multiple accounts to vote more than once or even millions at a time. The math problems prevent this by making each vote have a cost in computers and electricity. This means out-voting, or out-solving the majority to take over the ledger would effectively require out-spending the majority and this is an unlikely event. So, the math enables a fair vote in a decentralised system.



Two more important details about how the Bitcoin network prevents someone from pre-solving a puzzle to win the race are:

1. Each puzzle builds on previous answers, and the winner is not just the most recent solution, but the ledger version with the most total solutions. 

2. The puzzles are also extraordinarily special in that there are no tricks to solving them faster, other than by buying more computers and electricity.



These two properties underlie the entire system and give people assurance that solutions are truly from the majority, and not a clever attacker.



So, today you have learnt that Bitcoin is an electronic currency that‚Äôs based on a collaboratively maintained ledger. People transfer money by sending messages to miners describing where and how much money should move. Miners make sure that the messages are from the true account owners by checking digital signatures. And finally, the miners reach a consensus with each other through a math-based voting process.""")

Ever wondered if there's an easier way to complete transactions without having to deal with online wallets, banks, and third-party applications? Well, it's possible, thanks to the Blockchain.


A blockchain is a decentralised ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. Let‚Äôs look at this example to understand more about the blockchain. Imagine four friends Ray, Ted, Sam, and Kelvin meeting up for dinner. At the end of the meal, Ray pays the 80000 sats bill and all of them decide to split the expense equally amongst each other. Let's assume Kelvin, Ted and Sam have 30000 sats in reserve each while Ray has 5000 sats left after paying the 80000sats bill.


Kelvin sends 2000 sats to Ray and the transaction details are permanently created and recorded. This record also holds the number of bitcoin Kelvin and Ray now own. After Kelvin‚Äôs transaction, Ray now has 70000 sats while Kelvin has 10000 sats left. If Sam sends 20000 sats to Ray, Ray now owns 80000 sats while Sam owns 10000 sats. This transaction is also permanently recorded.""")


day_9_cont = str("""This chain of records or blocks is called a ledger and this ledger is shared among all the friends which acts as a public distributed ledger that forms the basis of the blockchain.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the transaction between Ray and Kelvin. Every user in the Bitcoin network has two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is an address that everyone in the network knows like an email address of a user, while the private key is a unique address that only the user has knowledge of something like a password.


As Kelvin sends Bitcoin to Ray‚Äôs Bitcoin address, the transaction is digitally signed by Kelvin‚Äôs private key through a hashing algorithm to indicate that the transaction came from Kelvin. The transaction is now sent to Ray's public address and can only be decrypted by Ray's private key, which only Ray knows. This transaction is then validated and added to a block by miners.

For a block to be validated and added to a blockchain, miners need to solve a complex mathematical problem. The miner who solves this first adds the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with 6.25 bitcoins. The process of solving the complex mathematical problem is called proof of work and the process of adding a block to the blockchain is called mining. With this process, Kelvin and Ray‚Äôs wallets are updated just like every person in the network who has completed a transaction.""")

Blockchain nodes


A node is a vital part of blockchain technology. A Bitcoin node is usually connected to the blockchain and holds a complete history of the Bitcoin blockchain, so it's safe to say that a Bitcoin node acts like a ledger that allows anyone to transparently see the transactions that are recorded on the network. A Bitcoin node also contributes to the security of the Bitcoin network through a consensus mechanism that sets and enforces the Bitcoin protocol rules about which transactions and blocks are valid and which transactions and blocks are invalid.



Any computer downloading the Bitcoin software or connected to the Bitcoin network keeps a record of all transactions and helps to validate transactions that meet the Bitcoin protocol rules is called a node. These nodes are usually devices which include servers, computers, laptops, online or desktop wallets, and even mobile phones.""")




day_10_cont = str("""There are 2 major kinds of nodes in the Bitcoin network:



A light node is smaller in size and only holds information about partial blockchain histories. It doesn‚Äôt store the whole blockchain, only a tiny part of it. Light nodes download block headers (a section in a block that summarises the rest of the block) to verify data and then transactions.



A full node keeps a copy of an entire blockchain history including every transaction on the network, timestamps, and all created blocks. Full nodes verify transactions, accept new blocks, and then broadcast the new transaction to other nodes. There are other reasons that encourage people to run a full node, such as contributing to the overall security of Bitcoin‚Äôs network and increasing the security of transactions, which is crucial if you plan to conduct numerous bitcoin transactions in a day.



But there is another specialised node called Miners. A Miner is a specialised node, which is basically a computer that solves a mathematical puzzle and adds transactions to a block. They receive transaction fees and block rewards in exchange for adding this transaction to a block. While Bitcoin full nodes verify transactions, they do not receive the block rewards.""")

Today, we are looking at how changes are made to the Bitcoin core.


Have you ever upgraded your Whatsapp? Maybe because there was a new version with brand new emojis or better features than the version you were using?

It is the same for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin core software gets updated when a need arises, and users and nodes may need to upgrade. Sometimes these upgrades are compulsory and require users and nodes connected to the Bitcoin network to upgrade to the newer version; other times, upgrading to newer versions of the Bitcoin software is optional. Before any change is made to the Bitcoin Core (or repository), there has to be consensus from the Bitcoin community of contributors and maintainers.


Changes to the Bitcoin repository can be made in 2 ways:



Hard Fork: This is a change to the Bitcoin software that requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the Bitcoin software because it is a permanent change from the previous version of the Bitcoin core and the old version is no longer compatible with the new version.
Soft Fork: In a soft fork, the newer version of the Bitcoin core is backwards-compatible with the old version. meaning that the upgraded nodes can still communicate with the non-upgraded ones. so miners decide whether they want to upgrade to the new protocol and update their machines and eventually, if approved by the majority of miners, at a predetermined block number, the changes will be made official and this is how miners will verify blocks from that point on unlike many other protocols.
But what happens to everyone‚Äôs bitcoin from the previous version if a change is implemented to the Bitcoin Core? Every change that is made to the Bitcoin Core needs to be backwards compatible which means that if someone holds bitcoin, their bitcoin will still be valid after the changes.



Other crypto network repositories are easier to change, but aren't backwards compatible which means that the holders of the coin need to transfer their coins to platforms that will accept the changes before a certain date or risk losing everything.



Because all Bitcoin changes need to be backwards compatible, it makes implementing changes harder. There is also no management team who ‚Äúhave the community‚Äôs best interest at heart‚Äù who will decide what new vision they have for their coin and implement changes regardless of what the community thinks.""")



day_11_cont = str("""The fact Bitcoin is so difficult to change makes it a great asset for the long run. Buyers know what they're buying, and they know that the asset will remain the same. No other asset in the world provides this level of security.



As it is decentralised, no one controls the Bitcoin network. It is an open secure network controlled and improved by every participant.



Let‚Äôs talk about risk.

We will use Bitcoin cash as our example here. As the number of participants was much lower than in bitcoin, there was a greater risk of attack and they fell victim to a 51% attack in 2021.

A miner's performance is based on the amount of computational power they have (usually referred to as hash rate or hashing power). The mining power is distributed over different nodes across the world which means it is not in the hands of a single entity.



But what happens when the hash rate is no longer distributed well enough? What happens if one single entity obtains more than 50% of the hashing power? One possible consequence is what we call a 51 attack also known as a majority attack.



A 51 attack is a potential attack on a blockchain network where a single entity or organisation controls the majority of the hash rate potentially causing a network disruption. In a scenario like this, the attacker would have enough mining power to intentionally exclude or modify the ordering of transactions. They could also reverse transactions they made while being in control leading to a double spending problem. A successful majority attack could also allow the attacker to prevent some or all transactions from being confirmed or to prevent miners from mining resulting in what is known as a mining monopoly.



A 51% attack on a large network like Bitcoin will be impossible because a tremendous amount of computing power which could cost over $13 billion will be required for a single entity to own enough hash power to manipulate the system.""")

Remember yesterday when we learnt about how changes are made to the Bitcoin core/repository? Well, today is a special day because you have 8 days left to get your 9000 sats and we‚Äôre spilling the tea on who controls the Bitcoin core. Bitcoin is controlled by Mr no one and validated by Miss everyone-who-runs-a-Node.

So absolutely no single person controls Bitcoin.



But what about the Bitcoin source code? What if someone makes unauthorised changes? Who exactly controls the ability to merge code changes into Bitcoin‚Äôs GitHub repository? How is the core protected and how hack-proof is it? How exactly does it operate?
So many questions you smart being!ü§ì. Lets start from the history of Bitcoin protocol.



The history of Bitcoin core:

The Bitcoin Core is the main point of development of the Bitcoin protocol rather than a point of command and control. If the current Bitcoin Core focal point stops existing, it will be replaced by another focal point. The fact that it works on GitHub is for convenience and not for some other purposes. The focal point is the point from which people/users/contributors can access, communicate with, or copy the latest bitcoin code/repository. Examples of a focal point include GitHub or SourceForge. 



In early 2009, the source code for the Bitcoin Project existed as a RAR file hosted on SourceForge and early developers exchanged code patches with Satoshi via email. In 2011, Bitcoin Project got its name changed to Bitcoin Core in 2014.

Many developers think that the network is being controlled based on the fact that the Bitcoin Core has maintainers who have admin rights to the Bitcoin Core focal point, but in reality they are working as technical support. If the maintainers were really able to add some code into the focal point, it would have most likely led to a complete change of the Bitcoin network by now.



Trust no one

Bitcoin Core‚Äôs GitHub repository has ‚ÄúMaintainer‚Äù accounts at the organisational level that can merge code into the master branch, this is more for maintenance purposes. If the Core was decentralised, that would allow anyone access to merge to the master branch and this would very quickly turn into a ‚Äútoo many cooks in the kitchen‚Äù scenario.

Bitcoin Core follows the maintainers system to avoid any abuse of power bestowed to individuals.""")



day_12_cont = str("""Many are of the opinion that GitHub employees might inject code into the Bitcoin focal point without consent from the maintainers. So, rather than base the integrity of the code on GitHub accounts, Bitcoin Core has a continuous integration system that performs checks of trusted PGP keys that must sign every merge commit. While these keys are linked to known identities, it‚Äôs still not safe to assume that it will always be the case‚Ääbecause ‚Ääa key could be compromised and we wouldn‚Äôt know unless the original key owner notified the other maintainers. As such, this does not guarantee 100% security from scammers does make illegal interference into the code more difficult. It is highly unlikely that a GitHub attacker would also be able to compromise the PGP key of a Bitcoin Core maintainer.



Who maintains the Core?  

Maintainers are participants who have already contributed to the project and worked on it for a long period. They can get more people into their team, but only after examining them for security measures.

There is a ‚ÄúMain‚Äù maintainer observing and coordinating the process. The changing of this Main from one person to another is known as Voluntary Passing. This right first moved from Satoshi Nakamoto to Gavin Anderson and then to Wladimir Van der Laan who has been the Main since 2014.



The role of "Main"maintainers is to ensure that the upgrades proposed by Bitcoin Core developers conform to the ethos of Bitcoin and implement them on Bitcoin Core.



We still can‚Äôt put all our trust in these maintainers so we should understand that there is a possibility of them giving keys to third parties. That is why there is a multi-layered security system, meaning with only just one key you won't be able to have control of the code. 

Importantly, network participants can remove maintainers if they believe they are working against the community‚Äôs shared vision of the Bitcoin network.



Additional security measures

The security of Bitcoin Core‚Äôs code must not rely only on PGP keys, which is why there are other checks and balances to provide more security to the core code and they include:



1. Pull Request: A consistent set of changes in the code base. At any given moment in time, the Bitcoin Core has many open pull requests. Reviewing pull requests is very important to move Bitcoin forward. Many pull requests are related to a specific Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), but this is not always the case.

2. Release Security: Deterministic build systems are run independently by multiple developers with the goal of creating identical binaries. If someone manages to create a build that doesn‚Äôt match the builds of other developers, it‚Äôs a sign that non-determinism was introduced and thus the final release isn‚Äôt going to happen. If there is non-determinism, developers track down what went wrong, fix it, then build another release candidate.

3. Constant vigilance: Despite all the technical security measures implemented, any of them could theoretically be compromised. The last line of defence for the integrity of Bitcoin Core‚Äôs code is the same as any other open-source project‚Ä¶ Constant vigilance. The more eyes reviewing Bitcoin Core‚Äôs code, the less likely that malicious or flawed code will make it into a release.""")

Muraho,


Once upon a time, the blockchain scalability trilemma was one of the greatest hurdles for cryptocurrencies because it was assumed that a cryptocurrency can only achieve 2 out of 3: either decentralisation, scalability, or security simultaneously, but never all 3. Trade-offs are inevitable. Initially, Bitcoin traded off scalability to ensure the network remained decentralised.



The Bitcoin scalability problem refers to the confined functionality of the Bitcoin network to handle large amounts of transaction data on the network within a short period of time. It is related to the fact that records (called blocks) in the Bitcoin blockchain are confined in size and frequency.



Bitcoin's blocks contains the transactions on the Bitcoin network.‚ÄäThe on-chain transaction processing capacity of the network is limited by the average block creation time of 10 minutes and the original block size limit of 1 megabyte. These jointly constrain the network's transaction processing time. The transaction processing capacity maximum estimated using an average or median transaction size is between 3.3 and 7 transactions per second.



The block size limit and the proof-of-work difficulty adjustment settings of Bitcoin's consensus protocol became the greatest limitation of the network as more people adopted the technology. 




Solving this became a pivotal moment in Bitcoin history. Remember day 11 when we shared that Bitcoin cash was a hard fork solution to solve Bitcoin scalability problem by increasing the block size in the blockchain. After implementing this, the Bitcoin blockchain split into two separate blockchains: one maintained in accordance with the rules currently valid for Bitcoin, and the other maintained in accordance with the rules currently valid for Bitcoin Cash. If one had coins on the Bitcoin chain prior to the fork and had not yet moved them, one could move them on one or the other or both chains. Thus, all holders of Bitcoin also became holders of Bitcoin Cash at the time of the split. Henceforth Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are separate and trade at entirely independent valuations relative to each other, fiat currencies, and other assets.



Segregated Witness, a soft fork solution was also proposed. Most Bitcoin Core developers considered increasing Bitcoin's block size limit as a way of increasing transaction capacity risky and preferred Bitcoin to grow by adding new protocol layers on top of Bitcoin's blockchain originally intended as a compromise between the opposing sides. Bitcoin Core developers proposed a protocol upgrade called Segregated Witness also known simply as SegWit. SegWit fixed the transaction issue in the Bitcoin protocol thereby enabling a particularly clever type of transaction layer called the Lightning Network while also including a block size limit increase.""")



day_14_cont = str("""SegWit could be deployed as a soft fork with a backwards compatible type of upgrade allowing users to opt in if, and when, they want to therefore minimising the risk of partitioning the network between upgraded and non-upgraded nodes to guarantee the safety of such an upgrade, soft fork  activation was usually coordinated through hash power once most miners signalled to be ready for the upgrade it would activate across the network but when SegWit was ready to be activated by late 2016, some major miners decided not to cooperate. They effectively blocked the soft fork, demanding it be paired with a backwards-incompatible hard fork upgrade to further increase the block size limit. Adding to the risks of even bigger blocks, this type of upgrade had a much bigger risk of partitioning the network.



Because of the controversial nature of this request, the miner's demand was off the table for Bitcoin Core developers. As miners continued their blocking, users were left waiting for SegWit. A few months went by until the pseudonymous developer, Shaolin Fry had an idea to break the deadlock. In early 2017, he dropped a new proposal to the Bitcoin development mailing list and the popular bitcointalk.org forum, a user activated softwork (UASF).



A user activated softwork would include a flag day which is a specific day in the future from which point on Bitcoin users would start enforcing the SegWit upgrade instead of miners coordinating the upgrade. Miners were given a deadline. If they failed to meet that deadline, the users would start rejecting their blocks. This proposal generated some buzz across Bitcoin news sites forums and social media. Shaolin Fry, with a group of maybe several dozen Bitcoiners, gathered in an open Slack channel to contemplate what such a UASF would look like exactly. It became a central point for discussion and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal was drafted to be numbered BIP 148 and a flag day was picked; 1 August 2017.



The 1 August UASF flag day turned into somewhat of a viral phenomenon, by summer many users had come to conclude that while miners could stop a specific upgrade mechanism, miners couldn't block SegWit itself. USERS not MINERS defined Bitcoin's Protocol and because of this powerful realisation, 1 August was dubbed Bitcoin Independence Day and, in the end, BIP 148 played out perfectly because it didn't need to be tested to its full extent. About a week ahead of 1 August, Miners activated the SegWit upgrade on their own and with this Bitcoin's block size limit was increased and the protocol was readied for the Lightning Network and other layer 2 solutions.



Although Miners ultimately activated the upgrade ahead of Flag Day deadline. August 1st was carved into Bitcoin history as the day users celebrate their sovereignty over the Bitcoin miners.

Bitcoin is getting adopted by so many, and when Bitcoin becomes adopted by a lot more people and a couple of million people decide to start utilising the network daily, the blockchain which serves as Bitcoin's "base layer," will be unable to support enough daily transactions for billions of users.

For instance, the transaction queue and fee rate would quickly increase as users compete to have their transactions processed. To solve this problem, a layered system called the lightning network was developed and deployed to allow the network to expand to handle the anticipated exponential growth in transaction quantities.

The lightning network is a special second layer "layer 2" of the Bitcoin blockchain adding faster payments using an "off-chain protocol" and additional functionality to Bitcoin. It is a solution to scaling that enables participants to dramatically speed up Bitcoin transactions while still retaining many interesting qualities of Bitcoin, such as non-custodial transactions and settlement, at very little cost for small payment values.

The Lightning Network is a network of payment channels between Lightning nodes. By routing payments through these Lightning nodes and only settling "channel closes" to the Bitcoin blockchain, Lightning enables many more Bitcoin transactions per second at a far cheaper cost than doing standard on-chain Bitcoin transactions. In a sense, it's like "closing the tab" at a bar and only paying one time instead of paying for each item. One trade-off required with Lightning Network participants is that they must be online for transactions.

In practice, if you are planning to use Bitcoin for "day-to-day" spending, then definitely consider using Lightning wallets instead of Bitcoin on-chain-only wallets. This will result in a much smoother experience for you. For larger values, you will be fine using Bitcoin on-chain transactions only.

We hope the sats you have stacked so far are safe?

Today, we want to teach you how to best hold your sats so you are always on the safe side. The Bitcoin network is like a series of deposit boxes at a train station. Everyone has access to and can see into the deposit box via the slit. They can also deposit bitcoin. To open the box, each box has its own pin. This is called the private key. Each box also has a number to identify it, this is called the Bitcoin address and the Bitcoin address is visible to everyone. The Bitcoin address is like your email address, public and visible to everyone but the password to access it is the private key. Each box is actually transparent, and anyone can see inside and see the number of bitcoin in it, but only you have access to the box because only you have the keys.



Let‚Äôs talk about the 3 most important things:

1.    Digital keys

2.    Bitcoin addresses

3.    Digital signatures



Digital Keys: Digital keys allow you to send and receive cryptocurrency without requiring a third party to verify the transactions. The digital keys in a user‚Äôs wallet are completely independent of the Bitcoin protocol and can be generated and managed by the user‚Äôs wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the Internet.""")


day_16_cont = str("""Keys come in pairs consisting of a private key and a public key. Think of the public key as a bank account number and the private key as the secret pin or signature on a check that provides control over the account. These digital keys are very rarely seen by the users of Bitcoin.

The private key is a number, usually picked at random, and the public key is generated from the private key using an elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function. A one-way cryptographic hash function is then used to generate a Bitcoin address from the public keys and the addresses stored inside the wallet file and managed by the bitcoin wallet software. In the regular way, you just have a password that locks a document and then you use the same password to unlock it. It‚Äôs like a key for your house: the key can lock and open the house. However, in private and public keys there's a completely different process that makes it work on the internet. There is a key that is used to open the lock and there's another key used to close the lock. The public key is called public because you might even publish it on the internet, however the private key is going to be private to you and the only thing it can do is open the Wallet.



Bitcoin Addresses: A bitcoin address is a string of digits and characters that can be shared with anyone who wants to send you money. Addresses produced from public keys consist of a string of numbers and letters, beginning with the digit ‚Äú1‚Äù, ‚Äú3‚Äù, or ‚Äúbc1‚Äù. And this is what appears as the receiver or sender of a transaction. Like we stated earlier, a Bitcoin address is derived from your public key using a one-way cryptographic hashing function.



Digital Signatures: Every transaction requires a valid signature to be included in the blockchain, which can only be generated with valid digital keys.

You‚Äôve learnt a lot about the theory, today it‚Äôs time to get practical and get stuck into Bitcoin wallets. To access your bitcoin, you need a wallet. The lightning wallet you set up at the beginning of this course is great, but now we want you to set up another of your choosing.



Bitcoin wallets are one of the most actively developed applications in the Bitcoin ecosystem. There is intense competition, and while a new wallet is probably being developed right now, several wallets from last year are no longer actively maintained. Many wallets focus on specific platforms or uses ‚Äì for example, some are more suitable for beginners while others are filled with features for advanced users. Choosing a wallet is highly subjective and depends on what you want to use it for and your level of Bitcoin knowledge.



That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs impossible to recommend a specific brand or project of wallet. However, we can categorise Bitcoin wallets according to their platform and function and provide some clarity about all the different types of wallets that exist.



Important: Moving money between Bitcoin wallets is easy, cheap, and fast, so it is worth trying out several different wallets until you find one that fits your needs.



A wallet is designed to:

Store your public and private keys

Send and receive bitcoin

Monitor your bitcoin balances

Interact with supported blockchains""")



day_17_cont = str("""There are different types of wallets and these wallets are categorised by 3 things:

Degree of ownership

Mode of usage

Interaction with the Bitcoin Network



1.    Degree of Ownership

A non-custodial wallet gives you full control over your private keys. Examples: paper wallets, hardware wallets, and software wallets.

Custodial wallet does NOT give you full control over your private keys. These wallets are operated by centralised crypto exchanges. Examples are Binance and Bitnob.





2. Mode of usage

A desktop wallet was the first type of Bitcoin wallet created as a reference implementation and many users run desktop wallets for the features, autonomy, and control they offer. Running on general-use operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS has certain security disadvantages however, as these platforms are often insecure and poorly configured.

A mobile wallet is the most common type of Bitcoin wallet. Running on smartphone operating systems such as Apple iOS and Android, these wallets are often a great choice for new users. Many are designed for simplicity and ease-of-use, but there are also fully featured mobile wallets for power users.

Web wallets are accessed through a web browser and store the user‚Äôs wallet on a server owned by a third party. This is like webmail in that it relies entirely on a third-party server. Some of these services operate using client-side code running in the user‚Äôs browser, which keeps control of the Bitcoin keys in the hands of the user. Most, however, present a compromise by taking control of the Bitcoin keys from users in exchange for ease-of-use. It is not advisable to store large amounts of bitcoin on third-party systems.

Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained bitcoin wallet on special-purpose hardware. They are operated via USB with a desktop web browser or via near-field-communication (NFC) on a mobile device. By handling all Bitcoin-related operations on the specialised hardware, these wallets are considered very secure and suitable for storing large amounts of bitcoin.

Paper wallet: The keys controlling bitcoin can also be printed for long-term storage. These are known as paper wallets even though other materials (wood, metal etc.) can be used. Paper wallets offer a low-tech but highly secure means of storing bitcoin long term. Offline storage is also often referred to as cold storage.



3. Interaction with the Bitcoin network:



The last way to categorise Bitcoin wallets is by their degree of autonomy and how

they interact with the Bitcoin Network:

A full client, or ‚Äúfull node,‚Äù is a client that stores the entire history of bitcoin transactions (every transaction by every user, ever), manages users‚Äô wallets, and can initiate transactions directly on the Bitcoin network. A full node handles all aspects of the protocol and can independently validate the entire blockchain and can start transactions. A full-node client consumes substantial computer resources (e.g., more than 125 GB of disk, 2 GB of RAM), but offers complete autonomy and independent transaction verification.

A lightweight client, also known as a simple-payment-verification (SPV) client, connects to bitcoin full nodes for access to the bitcoin transaction information, but stores the user wallet locally and independently creates, validates, and transmits transactions. Lightweight clients interact directly with the Bitcoin network, without an intermediary.""")



earn_17 = str("""Lightning wallets for beginners

Some Bitcoin mobile lightning wallets beginners can use include Blue Wallet, Wallet of Satoshi, or Munn wallet. We strongly recommend Munn wallet as it allows you to hold your own keys if you are not running their own lightning node.

day_18 = str("""‚úÖ DAY 18 ‚úÖ\n\nWhat‚Äôs up?



Now that you have an impressive knowledge of Bitcoin, let‚Äôs talk about how you earn the currency. The typical strategy for people new to Bitcoin is to first acquire a small amount of bitcoin (sats) while learning more about it and later, once they feel a bit more empowered, to purchase more.

We recommended Carrot app and Fountain FM in past emails as a way of earning, so how have you done so far?



Today we will be exploring and comparing the main methods of acquiring bitcoin:  purchasing, earning, and mining.




1. Direct purchase

For most people, simply purchasing Bitcoin is likely to be the easiest and most cost-effective way to acquire it. Typically, this will involve a process of:

Signing up with a Bitcoin exchange, Bitcoin buying service, or OTC (over-the-counter) desk.

Verifying your identity (usually driver's licence or passport).

Depositing fiat funds (lihe naira, cedis, rands etc.) via wire transfer or otherwise.

Purchasing Bitcoin.

Ideally, withdrawing the bitcoin to your custody.""")



day_18_cont = str("""Look for a reputable Bitcoin exchange or Bitcoin purchase service that has a good reputation for security and service built up over a long time.

We‚Äôve mentioned the saying ‚ÄúNot your keys, not your Bitcoin‚Äù before and it is good advice for selecting an exchange or service that permits you to purchase and withdraw the Bitcoin to private keys under your control. There are some services that simply provide "Bitcoin exposure" without any underlying control. For users wishing to purchase Bitcoin more privately, you may find it safer to buy Bitcoin using the Peer 2 Peer method(P2P).

P2P is a safer and more private way to purchase Bitcoin compared to KYC services that requires ID card verification, face verification, document verification such as utility bills as proof of address, and biometric verification before you can purchace Bitcoin. Using KYC services to buy Bitcoin means your Bitcoin can be traced back to you. You can use the P2P method to purchase Bitcoin at a local Bitcoin meetup. Many cities around the world offer these meetup groups. Following your country‚Äôs top Bitcoiners on Twitter is the best way to find out about meetups. And, of course, you can follow us on Twitter for more information too: @AfricanBitcoiners 



2. Earning



Another way to acquire bitcoin is by working in a job that pays in bitcoin. Selling products and services for bitcoin using "sats-back" (similar to cash-back) services such as Lolli or Fold that give you discounts or "Bitcoin back" for purchasing through their links or services. One benefit of earning Bitcoin is that, if done correctly, it can be more private than buying Bitcoin. Those looking for merchant processing for their online stores can look to Bitcoin merchant processing companies. For a more self-sovereign method, you can use free and open-source tools like BTCPay Server that let you run your own web store to receive bitcoin and generate "payment requests" to automatically request the correct amount of bitcoin at current exchange rates.


3. Mining


Mining is another way to earn Bitcoin and is arguably the most private way to acquire Bitcoin. There have historically been many mining-based scams that promise fantastic returns or hardware that is "too good to be true". Remain sceptical of anyone who promises very high mining returns. The proper way to mine Bitcoin is by setting up your own mining hardwares.

Bonjour 

Today, we are talking transactions. Transactions are the most important part of the Bitcoin Network. The entire Bitcoin system is designed to ensure that transactions can be created, sent on the network, validated, and finally added to the global ledger of transactions (the blockchain), and we are going to go over exactly what happens to a Bitcoin from the moment you hit the ‚Äúsend‚Äù button in your wallet until it‚Äôs received on the other end.


The path from send to receive has 3 parts:

1.    Signing

2.    Broadcasting 

3.    Confirming



1. Signing


Assuming Sally wanted to send Bitcoin to Bob, when Sally hits the ‚Äúsend‚Äù button in her wallet, what Sally is doing is telling her wallet, ‚ÄúHey wallet, I want to send 1 Bitcoin to my friend Bob. Here is Bob‚Äôs Bitcoin

address.‚Äù

The wallet, in response, creates a transaction message containing information about  Sally, Bob and the amount being sent. Afterwards, the wallet produces a unique digital signature for this message by mathematically mixing it with Sally's private key. Remember that Sally's private key is basically a long string of letters and numbers that act as the ‚Äúpassword‚Äù for her bitcoins. Whoever knows Sally's private key has control of her bitcoin.

A digital signature is a way to prove that you own the private key to your bitcoin and this is mathematically encrypted into your transaction so that  by using only your public key (which you will have no issue exposing), your private key is kept private.

Also, digital signatures are different each time you sign a transaction, and this is why they are even more secure than a real signature as they are unique for each and every transaction. So if Sally sends Bob bitcoin today and then some more tomorrow, each of these transactions will have a different digital signature. After signing the transaction message, the wallet then groups the signature, along with Sally's transaction message, into a small file.


2. Broadcasting""")


day_19_cont = str("""In this step, the wallet starts sending out the file to other computers that hold a copy of the blockchain. These computers are also known as nodes. Each node that receives the file verifies that it‚Äôs legit. It‚Äôs basically looking to see that Sally have the funds she wants to spend and that her signature checks out, much like a banker would check your account balance before clearing your check.


Once Sally's file is verified, it is then passed on to other nodes in the network that repeat this process. When a node receives a file, it keeps it in a holding area called the Mempool. Once the transaction message finds its way to the Mempool of the different online nodes on the network, we can say the second step of broadcasting is officially finished.

Let‚Äôs pause quickly and talk about the status of Sally's transaction at this point. For Sally to actually see what‚Äôs going on with her transaction, while it‚Äôs making its path along the Bitcoin network, she can use a block explorer. A block explorer is a tool, usually in the form of a website, that allows you to search and navigate through the blockchain. Using a block explorer, you can check the balance of different Bitcoin addresses, track transactions and get a wide variety of statistics about the network.



So, at this point, if Sally looks at her transaction through the block explorer, she will see that it is marked as ‚Äúunconfirmed‚Äù, meaning that it was broadcasted to the network and had its digital signature verified but it still isn‚Äôt part of the blockchain.

This type of transaction is also sometimes referred to as a zero confirmation transaction. An unconfirmed transaction should be treated as its name implies ‚Äì unconfirmed. This means that the transaction can be replaced.

If your business sells or ships goods and you accept payment in bitcoin, you should never accept an unconfirmed transaction as a proof of payment.



3. Confirming our transaction


On average, a new block of transactions will be mined, or inserted into the blockchain, every 10 minutes. Keep in mind that this is on average. Sometimes you‚Äôll get 2 blocks confirmed within 1 minute and sometimes it can take more than an hour. If a block was mined with your transaction in it, you‚Äôll notice it will now show on the block explorer, as having one confirmation.

As more and more blocks are added afterward, the confirmation number will grow. Think of it as a building of blocks with our block at the very bottom. Every additional block set on top of our own block makes it harder to remove. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs usually suggested to wait for at least 6 blocks before considering a transaction as fully confirmed without any chance of cancellation. Our transaction is now fully confirmed and received.""")

It is important to ensure the safety of the bitcoin in your wallet to prevent scams, theft, and loss of coin. There are many ways you can lose your Bitcoin including:

Losing the recovery seed

Leaving funds on exchanges

Getting tricked by sats doubling sites

Getting scammed
Leaving your wallet accessible with no password

Forgetting your password



Just like how we keep our cash or cards in a physical wallet, bitcoins are also stored in a wallet, a digital wallet.



As we have learnt, the digital wallet can be hardware-based or web-based. The wallet can also reside on a mobile device, on a computer desktop, or kept safe by printing the private keys and addresses used for access on paper.



But how safe are any of these digital wallets?



The answer to this depends on how the user manages the wallet. Every wallet contains a set of private keys without which the bitcoin owner cannot access the currency. The biggest danger in Bitcoin security is the individual user perhaps losing the private key or having the private key stolen. Without the private key, the user will never see their bitcoins again.

Besides losing the private key, a user can also lose their bitcoin by computer malfunctions (crashing a hard drive), by hacking, or by physically losing a computer where the digital wallet resides.



There are many ways also to ensure your bitcoin can never be lost:



Hot wallet:

Online wallets are also known as ‚Äúhot‚Äù wallets. Hot wallets are wallets that run on internet-connected devices like computers, phones, or tablets. The issue with ‚ÄúHot‚Äù wallets is that they create vulnerability because these wallets generate the private keys to your coins on these internet-connected devices. While a hot wallet can be very convenient in the way you are able to access and make transactions with your assets quickly, they also lack security.



People who are not taking security seriously enough when using these hot wallets can have their funds stolen and this can occur in many ways. Hot wallets are meant to be used for small amounts of Bitcoin.



Any financial coach will always advise anyone to hold only spending money in a checking account while the bulk of your money is in savings accounts or other investment accounts. The same could be said for hot wallets. Hot wallets encompass mobile, desktop, web, and most exchange custody wallets. It is important to note here that holding bitcoin in an exchange wallet is not the same as holding it in your personal wallet.



Exchange wallets are custodial accounts provided by the exchange. The user of this wallet type is not the holder of the private key to the cryptocurrency that is held in this wallet. If an event were to occur where the exchange is hacked or your account becomes compromised, your funds would be lost. Bitcoin exchanges do not provide insurance, making safe storage of Bitcoin especially important.""")



day_20_cont = str("""As we said, it is not advisable to keep large amounts of Bitcoin in any hot wallet, especially an exchange account. While these wallets are connected to the internet, creating a potential vector of attack, they are still very useful for the ability to quickly make transactions or trade bitcoin.

It is suggested that you withdraw the majority of your funds to a "cold" wallet.



Cold wallet

This wallet is the safest option for bitcoin storage as a cold wallet is a wallet that is not connected to the internet and therefore stands less chance of being compromised. 



The cold wallet stores a user‚Äôs address and private key on something that is not connected to the internet and typically comes with software that works in parallel so that the user can view their portfolio without putting their private key at risk.



Perhaps the most secure way to store bitcoin offline is via a paper wallet. A paper wallet is a cold wallet that you can generate from certain websites. It then produces both public and private keys that you print out on a piece of paper. The ability to access bitcoin in these addresses is only possible if you have that piece of paper. Many people laminate these paper wallets and store them in safety deposit boxes at their bank or even in a safe in their home. Paper wallets have no corresponding user interface other than a piece of paper and the blockchain itself.



Cold wallets are the most secure way to store your Bitcoin, however, they require a bit more knowledge to set up. It‚Äôs essential for anyone interested in owning bitcoin to learn about safe storage and the concepts of both hot and cold wallets. We highly recommend Sparrow wallet, which is a desktop wallet that allows you to set up a hot, cold or multi-signatory wallet. Check out how to set up a Sparrow wallet and as a bonus, it is built in Africa! Set up a Sparrow wallet.



Physical coins

Services are cropping up which allow Bitcoin investors to buy physical bitcoins. The coin you purchase will have a tamper-proof sticker covering a predetermined amount of Bitcoin. To purchase the physical coin, you may need to pay a slight premium over the value of the bitcoin that you're buying, owing to the cost of the manufacture and shipment of the coin itself.



Other security precautions

Backup your entire bitcoin wallet early and often. In case of a computer failure, a history of regular backups may be the only way to recover the currency in the digital wallet.

Keep your software up to date. A wallet running on non-updated bitcoin software can be a soft target for hackers. 
The concept of a multi-signature has gained some popularity. This involves an approval from a few people (say 3 to 5) for a transaction to take place. This limits the threat of theft as a single controller or server cannot carry out the transactions.

But there is one more lesson before you start celebrating.


So, let‚Äôs talk Altcoins


Altcoin is short for saying alternative coin. While both altcoins and bitcoin use blockchain technology, these digital assets can vary in their purpose, features and operation. There are as many as 20 000 alternative cryptocurrencies most of these altcoins are influenced by bitcoin market price. If bitcoin goes up, altcoins go up and if bitcoin goes down, they all go down (although there is a difference in % of increase or decrease). Sometimes we see exceptions of an altcoin that continue to rise when bitcoin goes down, but the likelihood or the probability of you choosing that one altcoin out of the thousands available is very low..""")



day_21_cont = str("""Bitcoin is a societal gamechanger and a force for good, but as good as bitcoin is, it has reawakened the irresistible desire of power-hungry individuals to control money production. History has proved that controlling money production is extraordinarily profitable for the issuer. It is now easier than ever to become a money producer and distribute it to millions of people. To this day, more than 7 000 alternative digital currencies have been created (and counting).



Every cryptocurrency has a person or people in the centre who want to create a new money that they have the most of, except Bitcoin. Creating an alternative "cryptocurrency" today only takes a few minutes which massively reduces the barrier of entry for money producers. These "cryptocurrency issuers" can trick individuals, businesses and investors into believing their worthiness. Most of these projects, if not all, are misguided or directly coordinated scams on a global scale that is causing a lot of problems. Only one class of people benefit from Altcoins in the long term: scammers.



Let's be clear: It's a free world so free market participants should be allowed to build businesses on whatever they please, IF fraud is out of the equation, and consistently called out.

Gambling within cryptocurrency exchanges, has been one of the most profitable business models around bitcoin but was rarely qualified with the right amount of risk disclosures to market participants. Hiding information from consumers buying products and services is the real issue.


No amount of regulatory oversight will prevent consumers from being defrauded until people understand that the market for money is unique. The market for money is one of the few markets in the world that is a winner-take-all in terms of the eventual dominant form of money. Just like we only use one internet, if one money is better than all the others, people will gravitate to it.
